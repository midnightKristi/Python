Thanks for submitting an issue!

* If this is a **feature request**, please make sure you explain the context, the goal, and why it is something that would go into bonobo core. Drafting some bits of spec is a good idea too, even if it's very draft-y.
  
* If this is a **bug report**, make sure you describe the expected and actual behaviour, eventually some minimal code or steps to reproduce the problem.
  
* If this is a **question**, please post it on slack overflow, and simply paste the question URL in an issue or in the slack channel. Also, when you get an answer, please consider contributing back the bits of documentation you would have loved to find in the first place.
